Ke Bo, Ph.D

I’m Ke Bo, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College. I use cutting-edge neuroimaging (EEG/fMRI/ECoG) and computational modeling to map how the brain generates and regulates emotion. My Ph.D. work decoded the spatiotemporal pathways of emotion, and in my postdoctoral research I developed a Bayesian framework to tease apart neural circuits of emotion regulation. Most recently, I’m uncovering how mitochondrial bioenergetics power everything from basic sensory processing to complex cognition and emotional health. My goal is to launch an integrated lab that reveals the bioenergetic roots of emotional resilience and disorder.
